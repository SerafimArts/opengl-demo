     * @param positive-int $size Specifies the number of bytes required by the structure. This value does not include
     *                           the size of the color table or the size of the color masks, if they are appended to the
     *                           end of structure.
     * @param int $width Specifies the width of the bitmap, in pixels.
     * @param int $height Specifies the height of the bitmap, in pixels.
     *                    - For uncompressed RGB bitmaps, if {@see self::$height} is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up
     *                      DIB with the origin at the lower left corner. If {@see self::$height} is negative, the
     *                      bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.
     *                    - For YUV bitmaps, the bitmap is always top-down, regardless of the sign of
     *                      {@see self::$height}. Decoders should offer YUV formats with positive {@see self::$height},
     *                      but for backward compatibility they should accept YUV formats with either positive or
     *                      negative {@see self::$height}.
     *                    - For compressed formats, {@see self::$height} must be positive, regardless of image
     *                      orientation.
     * @param positive-int $planes Specifies the number of planes for the target device. This value must be set to 1.
     * @param positive-int $bitCount Specifies the number of bits per pixel (bpp). For uncompressed formats, this value
     *                               is the average number of bits per pixel. For compressed formats, this value is the
     *                               implied bit depth of the uncompressed image, after the image has been decoded.
     * @param Compression $compression For compressed video and YUV formats, this member is a FOURCC code, specified as
     *                                 a DWORD in little-endian order. For example, YUYV video has the FOURCC 'VYUY' or
     *                                 0x56595559.
     *
     *                                  For uncompressed RGB formats, the following values are possible:
     *                                  - 0x0000 (BI_RGB) - Uncompressed RGB.
     *                                  - 0x0003 (BI_BITFIELDS) - Uncompressed RGB with color masks.
     *                                    Valid for 16-bpp and 32-bpp bitmaps.
     *
     *                                  For 16-bpp bitmaps, if biCompression equals BI_RGB, the format is always RGB555.
     *                                  If {@see self::$compression} equals BI_BITFIELDS, the format is either RGB555 or
     *                                  RGB565. Use the subtype GUID in the AM_MEDIA_TYPE structure to determine the
     *                                  specific RGB type.
     * @param positive-int $sizeImage Specifies the size, in bytes, of the image. This can be set to 0 for uncompressed
     *                                RGB bitmaps.
     * @param int $xPelsPerMeter Specifies the horizontal resolution, in pixels per meter, of the target device for the
     *                           bitmap.
     * @param int $yPelsPerMeter Specifies the vertical resolution, in pixels per meter, of the target device for the
     *                           bitmap.
     * @param positive-int $clrUsed Specifies the number of color indices in the color table that are actually used by
     *                              the bitmap.
     * @param positive-int $clrImportant Specifies the number of color indices that are considered important for
     *                                   displaying the bitmap. If this value is zero, all colors are important.
